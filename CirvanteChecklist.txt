- identify your development environment and make sure you have all the tools set up
  * Visual Studio (i'm using 2019, but earlier versions should work)
  * C# is the primary development language. a custom scripting language or something like Lua may be added in later, but that's not important for now
  * a compiled version of the MonoGame framework library must be installed on the developer's machine
  * developers will also need the MonoGame Content Builder application to build assets into the game format

- identify your concept of operations and draft a rough systems-level description of your design approach

- clearly define your statement of work (this is especially important re: engine flexibility)

- define a set of high-level requirements from said concept of operations and statement of work

- draft your software development plans

- draft a rough timeline estimate with high-level milestones

- set up your repository, task tracking tools, test frameworks, CI/CD pipelines, etc.
